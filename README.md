# Daily Quotes

A SvelteKit project that displays a random quote. This app was built to learn data fetching, stores in SvelteKit, and UI styling with Shadcn.

## Why I Made This

Daily Quotes is a practice project to explore SvelteKit's data fetching and state management using stores, as well as to experiment with Shadcn for custom UI design.

## TODO

- [ ] Cache quote to display only one a day
- [ ] Nicer UI

## Running Locally
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-quotes.git # clones the repository
  cd daily-quotes # change directory
  npm install # installs dependencies
  npm run dev # run development server
  ```
  Then go to `localhost:5173` to see the application
